Defination of Express: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed to make it easier to build web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and various other tasks involved in web development.
 Key features of Express.js include:

 Routing: Express provides a straightforward way to define routes for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URL patterns.

 Middleware: Middleware functions in Express are used to perform tasks in the request-response cycle. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

 Template Engines: Express supports various template engines (such as EJS, Pug, and Handlebars) to render dynamic HTML pages on the server side.

 HTTP Utility Methods and Middleware: Express includes built-in methods for handling common tasks related to HTTP, such as setting headers, redirecting, and handling cookies.

 Static File Serving: Express can serve static files (like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files) with ease.
